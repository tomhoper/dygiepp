aiy8clpy_abstract	The work reported here demonstrates : ( 1 ) fusion of SUMO ( small ubiquitin - related modifier ) , a 100 amino acid polypeptide , to the N - termini of SARS - CoV proteins dramatically enhances expression in Escherichia coli cells and ( 2 ) 6× His - tagged SUMO - fusions facilitate rapid purification of the viral proteins on a large scale . We have exploited the natural chaperoning properties of SUMO to develop an expression system suitable for proteins that can not be expressed by traditional methodologies . A unique feature of the system is the SUMO tag , which enhances expression , facilitates purification , and can be efficiently cleaved by a SUMO - specific protease to generate native protein with a desired N - terminus . We have purified various SARS - CoV proteins under either native or denaturing conditions . These purified proteins have been used to generate highly specific polyclonal antibodies . Our study suggests that the SUMO - fusion technology will be useful for enhancing expression and purification of the viral proteins for structural and functional studies as well as for therapeutic uses .	fusion of SUMO ( small ubiquitin - related modifier ) , a 100 amino acid polypeptide , to the N - termini of SARS - CoV proteins	enhances	expression in Escherichia coli cells
